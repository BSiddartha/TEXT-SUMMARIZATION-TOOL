#DESCRIPTION:The Text Summarization Tool is an NLP-based solution designed to generate concise summaries from lengthy articles using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This tool tokenizes input text, removes stopwords, and applies frequency-based scoring to rank and extract the most relevant sentences, ensuring that the summary retains the core meaning of the original text. It is particularly useful for research, news aggregation, and summarizing long reports. By leveraging NLTK’s robust text-processing capabilities, the tool efficiently condenses large volumes of information into shorter, more readable formats.

#INPUT: For those of you traditional data scientist who are interested in AI but still haven’t given it a deep dive, here’s a high level overview of the data science technologies that combine into what the popular press calls artificial intelligence (AI).
2808322930We and others have written quite a bit about the various types of data science that make up AI.  Still I hear many folks asking about AI as if it were a single entity.  It is not.  AI is a collection of data science technologies that at this point in development are not even particularly well integrated or even easy to use.  In each of these areas however, we’ve made a lot of progress and that’s caught the attention of the popular press.
This article is not intended to be a deep dive but rather the proverbial 50,000 foot view of what’s going on.  If you’re a traditional data scientist who’s read some articles but still hasn’t put the big picture together you might find this a way of integrating your current knowledge and even discovering where you’d be interested in focusing.
AI is Simply the Sum of its Data Science Parts
The data science ‘parts’ that make up AI fall in into the following categories.  There is overlap here but these are the detailed topics you’ll see in the press.
Deep Learning
Natural Language Processing
Image Recognition
Reinforcement Learning
Question Answering Machines
Adversarial Training
Robotics
These are all separate disciplines (OK the category of Deep Learning actually contains some of the others).  AI is simply the sum of these parts. They hang together only very loosely and have been bolted together into some really marvelous applications by a whole host of startups and major players.  When they work well together as they do for example in Watson, or Echo/Alexa, or as they are starting to do in self-driving cars then they may appear to be more than the sum of their parts.  But they’re not.  Integration of these different technologies is still one of the biggest challenges.
What Must Our AI be Able to Do?

#OUTPUT:
For those of you traditional data scientist who are interested in AI but still haven’t given it a deep dive, here’s a high level overview of the data science technologies that combine into what the popular press calls artificial intelligence (AI). Generative Adversarial Neural Nets (GANNs):  CNNs and RNNs both suffer from the same problem of requiring huge and burdensome amounts of data in order to train, either to recognize that stop sign (image) or to learn the instructions necessary to answer your question about how to open that account (speech and text).
